Hello Answer Digital!

Thank you for that great assessment, it really helped me to practice and learn! 

My TCs are working with Google Chrome and you need to change one line of the code for each of them to run.
Nothing big, just where you have downloaded the ChromeDriver on your machine.

Many thanks!
